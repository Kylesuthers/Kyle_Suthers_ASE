“I need to do these steps using boose, step 1 extend ICanvas to have your new draw command…”
“for step one how do i make sure its an interface?”
“How do I make an interface here, and where do I put it?”
“Should I select class or should I select interface?”
“Should I delete all this automatic code?”
“Do I change name or text in VS Properties?”
“there is no multiline, scrollbars, height options”
“whats after the form image is done?”
“instead of just showing me the answer canb you teach me how to do each step starting at step 4”
“instead of a bitmap what else can be used as a canvas?”
“what about a website?”
“ok lets go back to learning about BOOSE and  incorporate the work in progress requirements too”
“when adding boose.dll to tests it says invalid or unsupported”
“i have no application tab”
“The errors appeared when i tried to use the clean solution”
“RunBooseProgram does not exist in the current context”
“define this, RunBooseProgram, in its simplest form”
“where does it go?”
“spot the error?” (Command factory screenshot)
“Parser does not contain a definition for 'Compile”
“the program doesnt say Program ran successfully in the output box”
“the program doesnt run”
“there should be a class that is a command factory that does all the commands by overriding the original, how does that work?”
“When running the draw commands, can I make it so it only draws inside the picturebox and not across the whole canvas?”
“How do we implement clear? here is ICanvas”
“i think i have messed up, using System; using System.Diagnostics…”
“i dont know where void ICanvas.DrawTo is”
“explain this code?” (MyRect)
“can some simplification be done here?” (MyCircle)
“Drawto isn’t complete is it done like moveto? ”
“what does each part do?”
“i want to commit what i have done so far give me a clear git commit message”
“Give me a list of everything we have done today”
“Let's talk about creating some unit testing classes for the classes we have so far”
“Can I put each test class inside a folder to keep them separated ?”
“show an example of a single unit test for mycircle, myrect, Mydrawto and mymoveto... also unit tests for appcommandfactory and Appcanvas”
"I am hitting an int limit restriction; the BOOSE parser has a limit of 10, public class Parser : IParser { private const int 뼅 = 10; }.
"If I override the parser with my own version, can I just override the limit restriction and will the rest of the original parser still run?"
